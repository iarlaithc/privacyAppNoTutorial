In relation to code, obfuscation is the process of intentionally making the code more difficult to understand or reverse-engineer, by altering its structure, variables, and naming conventions, without changing its functionality.  For this reason, the app was reverse-engineered and its inner workings exposed, allowing for access to the “private” API.",
